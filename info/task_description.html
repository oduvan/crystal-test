    A crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents, such as atoms, molecules or ions, are
    arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions.
    The scientific definition of a "crystal" is based on the microscopic arrangement of atoms inside it,
    called the crystal structure. A crystal is a solid where the atoms form a periodic arrangement.

<p>
    It's very important to check crystal quality when you are growing and harvest them.
    For the first quick checking we will use various random atom lines from crystals.
    Our crystal contains two atoms - "X" (Xenatom) and "Z" (Zorium).
</p>

<p>
    You are given a random line from crystal lattice as a sequence of letters "X" and "Z".
    The good line should have the periodic arrangement as ["X", "Z", "X", "Z"].
    If any atoms are repeated, then this crystal is broken.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Atom line as a list of strings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Is a line good or not as a boolean.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <textarea data-code="python">check_line(["X", "Z", "X"]) == True
check_line(["X", "Z", "X", "X"]) == False</textarea>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is first simple data structure and here you can learn how to work with a list.
    And simple concept -- don't try to solve any problem in forehead. Think.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    0 &lt; len(line) &le; 1000<br>
    all(ch in "XZ" for ch in line)
